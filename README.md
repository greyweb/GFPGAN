# GFP-GAN

GFPGAN aims at developing a Practical Algorithm for Real-world Face Restoration.
It leverages rich and diverse priors encapsulated in a pretrained face GAN (e.g., StyleGAN2) for blind face restoration.

## Description

I am sharing a colab notebook which I had used to experiment and see the results of GFP-GAN from https://github.com/TencentARC/GFPGAN
